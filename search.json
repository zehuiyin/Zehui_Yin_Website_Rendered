Travel behavior insights from Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Travel Behaviour and Society, 34, 100663. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2023.100663\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\n\n\n\nShared e-scooters are quickly emerging in the U.S., presenting potential to enhance public transit by serving as a last-mile feeder mode. However, much is unknown about user preferences and travel behavior regarding e-scooter and transit integration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a travel behavior survey in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, California, both early adopters of dockless micromobility. We find that the last-mile problem deters transit use for about 70% of respondents, among whom over 60% have considered e-scooters for last-mile transit connections. However, this intention frequently did not translate into actual use due to a variety of barriers. We further developed ordinal and binary logit models to examine factors shaping intention and actual use of shared e-scooters as a last-mile solution. Results suggest the outcomes of interest are positively associated with transit use frequency and safety rating of e-scooter riding. Somewhat surprisingly, household income is not a significant variable in all models. Women and older adults are less likely to consider using e-scooters as a last-mile feeder mode. People of color and individuals without a college degree who ride e-scooters have a greater percentage of their shared e-scooter trips made to connect with transit compared to White people and those with a college degree. These findings contribute to the understanding of equity in shared micromobility. Finally, to promote transit and micromobility integration, policymakers may introduce bundled fares, integrated payment, promote e-scooter safety, increase e-scooters availability at transit stops, and improve bike lane infrastructure connecting to transit."

Available at: https://hazards.colorado.edu/quick-response-report/survey-of-evacuation-behavior-in-the-2021-marshall-fire-colorado\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is increasing the threat of wildfires to urban areas, especially those within the wildland-urban interface (WUI). The 2021 Marshall Fire forced the evacuation of 30,000 people and destroyed over 1,000 structures within Boulder County, Colorado. We conducted a survey with households affected by the grass fire to analyze their evacuation decision-making and travel behavior. The survey was based on previous surveys that members of our team developed to investigate the public response to the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire in Tennessee and the 2019 Kincade Fire in California, but we have included new measures of transportation mode, route, and destination choices made by evacuees. We used linear and logistic regression models to determine the factors that influenced resident risk perception and the decision to evacuate and compared results from our analysis to the previous studies. We found significant variability in the factors that influenced risk perception and evacuation decisions across the three fires. The report also presents descriptive statistics to summarize our findings on evacuee travel behavior during the Marshall Fire."

    "text": "Workflow:\n\nGenerate 3D building models on the UF campus\n\nIn the ArcGIS CityEngine, first, create a new project with a new scene. Then click file &gt; get map data, selecting the UF campus area. After that, align the downloaded 3D building models to the terrains. Finally, export the 3D building models into Esri Scene Layer Package (.slpk).\n\nDownload the JSON file from RTS API and convert it into Geojson\n\nDue to the API limitations, there is no command to return all the vehicles’ locations. To get around this, we need to create a python script to automate the multiple downloads and merge them into one file. In the “download_request_example.py”, I called the API four times to return different routes’ bus locations which together merged into one JSON that contains all the vehicle locations. Please note that each time I called the API, I filtered the JSON response from the API. Only after the proper filter, the JSON file’s structure is recognizable and convertible by the converter python script. Also, I created four artificial vehicle locations at the end of the JSON file which contains all four different occupancy levels of the buses, by doing this the legend in the later web app would always contain the four occupancy levels.\nThen we use the cmd to call the converter python script. Firstly, we set the directory to where the converter is located. Then we use the following code:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" Json2GeoJSON.py &lt;json file location&gt;\nAfter the first run, the converter python script would create an ini file alongside the JSON file you use as the input. The first conversion would likely be unsuccessful as the configuration in the ini file is just created and not manually corrected based on the input data. After the first conversion, correct the ini file to exactly the same as the gainData.ini.\n\nUpload the models and layers to ArcGIS Online\n\nGet all the background layers like City of Gainesville roads, transit routes and stops from the city website’s open data portal. Upload all the background layers as well as the slpk file in step 1 and the Geojson file in step 2 to the ArcGIS online. Note: create a hosted feature layer for the Geojson file during the upload, as we will later constantly update it to make a real-time map.\n\nCreate a web scene and further use it to create a web app\n\nIn ArcGIS Online, use the feature layers that have been uploaded to firstly create a web scene. Then create a web app using the web scene. Remember in the web scene setting to set the refresh time to the minimum, which will reduce the update interval in the ArcGIS server later.\n\nConfig constant upload bat file in a local computer\n\nBefore updating the hosted feature layer that contains the vehicle information, we need to first store the ArcGIS authentication locally. Due to the UF Gatorlink using two-factor authentication to log in, it would be troublesome to simply store the username and password on the computer. The way to get around this is to first use the following python command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(url=&lt;organization_arcgis_portal&gt;, username='', password='', profile='learn_user')\nThis command would store your username and password in the learn_user profile, however, so far it cannot go through the ArcGIS Online portal yet. After this then, before updating the feature layer, call the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment while keeping ArcGIS Pro running in the background:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(\"pro\", profile='learn_user')\nThis command would use ArcGIS Pro to authenticate the profile called learn_user. Please note that use the same account you use in ArcGIS Online in ArcGIS Pro.\nThen we can update the hosted feature layer that contains all the vehicle locations by the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" OverwriteFS.py learn_user &lt;ID&gt; &lt;Name&gt; &lt;location of your downloaded json file&gt;\nNote the ID and the name correspond to the upper right corner and the lower-left corner respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use the windows task scheduler to run the bat file every minute to automatically update the hosted feature layer. Or we can use the Invisible_mode_exxec.vbs to hiddenly execute the bat file. Please note that if you want to schedule a task to run the vbs, you need to use the following setting:\nAction: Start a program\nProgram/script: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\nAdd arguments (optional): C:\\Scripts\\script.vbs"

What are the travel speeds of cyclists in the Bikeshare Toronto System?\nRQ2. To what extent do the existing bike lanes complement the Bikeshare Toronto System?\n\nTo answer these two research questions, I simulated the shortest cycling paths between every pair of Toronto bike-share stations using the OpenStreetMap road network and the R5 routing engine. I estimated the average cycling speed within the system by calculating the seasonal average cycling speeds at each station. I also created the estimated travel flow by aggregating the simulated paths and visually comparing them with the existing bike lanes in Toronto. The project results showed that the average travelling speed in the bike-share system was at least 12 km/h and that the existing bike lanes did not complement the bike-share system well.\nYou can find codes used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

What are the seasonal spatial pattern differences in Toronto bike-share trips at station levels?\nRQ2. What are the similarities and differences between the locations, trip count percentages, built environments, and social demographics of Toronto bike-share stations?\n\nThe first research question sought to examine the seasonal spatial pattern differences in Toronto bike-share trips at station levels. Through the use of spatial analysis techniques, the project aimed to identify any patterns or trends in the distribution of bike-share trips across different seasons.\nThe second research question aimed to identify similarities and differences between the various bike-share stations in Toronto. The project analyzed a range of factors, including location, trip count percentages, built environments, and social demographics, to provide a taxonomy of the stations.\nThe project highlights the potential of GIS tools and techniques in analyzing and understanding complex spatial patterns and relationships. Through the analysis of the Bike Share Toronto system, the project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of the system and the factors that influence bike-share usage in the city.\nYou can find codes used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

As a research assistant in the Suburban Mobilities Cluster under the supervision of Dr. Steven Farber in the Human Geography Department at UTSC, I am also currently exploring ways to understand and improve transportation accessibility and efficiency in suburban areas, with a particular emphasis on Scarborough, Ontario.\nMy interests in spatial analysis and econometrics have inspired me to delve into examining the spatial patterns of social issues, with a particular focus on using GIS and statistical tools to visualize and analyze these patterns. With my extensive experience in R programming and proficiency in a variety of GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, I am well-equipped to tackle complex spatial and social problems from a quantitative approach.\nMoreover, as a passionate transit enthusiast, I find myself constantly drawn to the topic of public transit and transportation. I enjoy riding buses and trains, and this interest has motivated me to explore ways of enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of public transit. I am eager to utilize my interdisciplinary background to further investigate public transit and transportation through spatial analysis and econometrics, with the aim of finding solutions to improve their functionality and accessibility."
