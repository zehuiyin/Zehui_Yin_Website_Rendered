Spatiotemporal insights from a novel dataset. Journal of Transport Geography, 114, 103778. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2023.103778\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first- and last-mile (FM/LM) problem is a major deterrent to public transit use. With the rise of shared micromobility options such as shared e-scooters in recent years, there is a growing interest in understanding their potential to serve as a last-mile transit solution. However, empirical data regarding the integrated use of shared micromobility and public transit have been limited so far. As a result, much is unknown regarding the spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of shared micromobility trips serving as an FM/LM connection to transit. This paper addresses these knowledge gaps by leveraging a novel dataset (i.e., the Spin post-ride survey dataset) that records thousands of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC. Specifically, we used the dataset to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC, resulting in some major policy insights regarding the integral use of shared e-scooters and public transit. We further leveraged the dataset to validate if and to what extent a commonly applied buffer-zone approach can infer FM/LM micromobility trips accurately. Statistical tests showed that the actual FM/LM Spin e-scooter trips differ from inferred FM/LM Spin e-scooter trips in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This indicates that the common practice of inferring FM/LM micromobility trips with a buffer-zone approach can lead to inaccurate estimates of transit-connecting micromobility trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, E., Yin, Z., Broaddus, A., & Yan, X. (2024). Shared e-scooters as a last-mile transit solution? Travel behavior insights from Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Travel Behaviour and Society, 34, 100663. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2023.100663\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\n\n\n\nShared e-scooters are quickly emerging in the U.S., presenting potential to enhance public transit by serving as a last-mile feeder mode. However, much is unknown about user preferences and travel behavior regarding e-scooter and transit integration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a travel behavior survey in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, California, both early adopters of dockless micromobility. We find that the last-mile problem deters transit use for about 70% of respondents, among whom over 60% have considered e-scooters for last-mile transit connections. However, this intention frequently did not translate into actual use due to a variety of barriers. We further developed ordinal and binary logit models to examine factors shaping intention and actual use of shared e-scooters as a last-mile solution. Results suggest the outcomes of interest are positively associated with transit use frequency and safety rating of e-scooter riding. Somewhat surprisingly, household income is not a significant variable in all models. Women and older adults are less likely to consider using e-scooters as a last-mile feeder mode. People of color and individuals without a college degree who ride e-scooters have a greater percentage of their shared e-scooter trips made to connect with transit compared to White people and those with a college degree. These findings contribute to the understanding of equity in shared micromobility. Finally, to promote transit and micromobility integration, policymakers may introduce bundled fares, integrated payment, promote e-scooter safety, increase e-scooters availability at transit stops, and improve bike lane infrastructure connecting to transit.",

The 2021 Marshall Fire forced the evacuation of 30,000 people and destroyed over 1,000 structures within Boulder County, Colorado. We conducted a survey with households affected by the grass fire to analyze their evacuation decision-making and travel behavior. The survey was based on previous surveys that members of our team developed to investigate the public response to the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire in Tennessee and the 2019 Kincade Fire in California, but we have included new measures of transportation mode, route, and destination choices made by evacuees. We used linear and logistic regression models to determine the factors that influenced resident risk perception and the decision to evacuate and compared results from our analysis to the previous studies. We found significant variability in the factors that influenced risk perception and evacuation decisions across the three fires. The report also presents descriptive statistics to summarize our findings on evacuee travel behavior during the Marshall Fire.",

    "text": "Abstract:\n\n\n\nBike thefts pose a significant deterrent to urban cycling. This research delves into the influence of police presence on bike thefts and the geographical scope of its deterrent effect. Leveraging bike theft records from 2014 to 2023 in Toronto, alongside the most recent Canadian census data, I employ two-way fixed-effect Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression models to scrutinize the impact of network walking distance to the nearest police facility on the number of bike thefts within each census tract. To ensure robustness, I present a variety of model specifications, including OLS multiple regressions, Poisson regressions, and standard Negative Binomial Regression. The findings indicate that a police facility within a 500-metre radius notably curtails bike thefts, with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. Yet, this deterrent effect wanes with increasing distance and becomes inconsequential beyond 500 metres. Furthermore, at distances exceeding 2 kilometres, the presence of police facilities does not influence the number of bike thefts. The study infers that police facilities exert a localized effect on bike theft prevention in urban areas. Consequently, merely increasing the number of police facilities city-wide is not an efficacious strategy for reducing bike theft. Policymakers are thus encouraged to consider alternative methods or strategies for enhancing crime deterrence.\n\n\nThis project addresses the following two research questions:\n\nWhat causal influence does the presence of police facilities have on the frequency of bike thefts in Toronto?\nUpon observing a deterrent effect, to what extent does the proximity of police facilities causally mitigate bike theft incidents in Toronto?\n\nYou can find the code used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "text": "I created an R package called sifr that allows users to perform basic spatial interpolation of sociodemographic and built-environment variables. These variables are useful for studying the characteristics and patterns of urban spaces, especially subway stations. The package contains functions that can take point data, such as the coordinates of subway stations, and interpolate the values of variables based on the surrounding areas such as calculating population density fall inside the subway station geometry buffers. These interpolated variables can then be used as inputs for cluster analysis or econometric analysis to explore the relationships between subway stations and their context such as built environments. The package is mainly designed for point data, but it may also work with other types of spatial data (which have not been thoroughly tested). You can find the source code of the package here.

What are the travel speeds of cyclists in the Bikeshare Toronto System?\nRQ2. To what extent do the existing bike lanes complement the Bikeshare Toronto System?\n\nTo answer these two research questions, I simulated the shortest cycling paths between every pair of Toronto bike-share stations using the OpenStreetMap road network and the R5 routing engine. I estimated the average cycling speed within the system by calculating the seasonal average cycling speeds at each station. I also created the estimated travel flow by aggregating the simulated paths and visually comparing them with the existing bike lanes in Toronto. The project results showed that the average travelling speed in the bike-share system was at least 12 km/h and that the existing bike lanes did not complement the bike-share system well.\nYou can find codes used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "text": "# load packages used in this post\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(latex2exp)\n\nTime-series regression is a common method to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables over time. However, this method can be biased if the dependent variable follows an autoregressive process, which means that its current value depends on its past values. In this blog post, I will explore the nature and magnitude of this bias, following the work of Alex and Kendall (1954).\nThe first step is to generate data from an AR(1) process. An AR(1) process is defined by the following equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n  y_t=&\\rho y_{t-1}+u_t\\\\\n  where\\ &u_t\\sim N(0,1)\\\\\n  &y_0\\sim N(0,1)\n\\end{array}\n\\] Due to the endogeneity issues, the OLS estimate for the following regression would produce biased estimate for \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\).\n\\[\ny_t=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\rho}y_{t-1}+\\epsilon_t\n\\]\nTo generate data from this process and carry out estimation, I use the following R code:\n\nar1_bias &lt;- function(n, rho, times) {\n  return_df &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = times, ncol = length(rho)))\n  colnames(return_df) &lt;- gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))\n  \n  for (count in 1:times) {\n    # create a dataframe to hold samples\n    df &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = n, ncol = length(rho)))\n    colnames(df) &lt;- gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))\n    \n    for (i in 1:length(rho)) {\n      df[1, i] &lt;- rnorm(1)\n      for(j in 2:n) {\n        df[j, i] &lt;- rho[i]*df[j-1, i] + rnorm(1)\n      }\n    }\n    \n    for (i in colnames(df)) {\n      df[, paste0(i, \"_1\")] &lt;- Lag(df[,i])\n    }\n    \n    ols_estimate &lt;- data.frame(rho = rho, rho_hat = NA)\n    j &lt;- 1\n    \n    for (i in gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))) {\n      str_exp &lt;- paste0(i, \"~\", i, \"_1\")\n      exp_for &lt;- as.formula(str_exp)\n      holder &lt;- lm(exp_for, data = df)\n      ols_estimate[j,2] &lt;- holder$coefficients[[2]]\n      j &lt;- j + 1\n    }\n    \n    ols_estimate$diff &lt;- ols_estimate$rho_hat - ols_estimate$rho\n    return_df[count,] &lt;- ols_estimate$diff\n  }\n  \n  return(return_df)\n}\n\nThe bias in the OLS estimation is calculated as\n\\[\n\\hat{Bias}=E(\\hat{\\rho}-\\rho)=E(\\hat{\\rho})-\\rho\n\\]\nHere we carry out simulations for different values of \\(\\rho\\) and sample size \\(n\\).\n\n# for reproductivity\nset.seed(123)\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 51, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=51\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 101, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=101\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 301, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=301\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we can see the bias increases as the population parameter \\(\\rho\\) approaches 1 and the bias persists even when \\(\\rho=0\\).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\n\n\n\nOver the last two to three decades, urban centers globally have shown a growing commitment to enhancing active transportation infrastructure, including the establishment of dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing initiatives, and comprehensive active mobility networks (City of Toronto, n.d.). Toronto’s endorsed docked bike-sharing program, Bike Share Toronto, has been supported by Tangerine Bank since 2011 (Bike Share Toronto, n.d.; El-Assi et al., 2017). While bike-sharing systems inherit the general advantages of cycling, they also offer unique benefits like increased convenience and potential cost savings (Fishman, 2016). Nonetheless, these systems encounter specific challenges that can impede their accessibility and equitable use among diverse demographic groups, primarily due to the fixed docking stations and associated first and last-mile connectivity issues. This study scrutinizes the Bike Share Toronto system through the lens of equity. Employing catchment area analysis, we discovered disparities in service provision: an oversupply to White, Chinese, and low-income populations contrasted with an undersupply to Black and female demographics. These findings indicate significant opportunities for enhancing the system’s equitable distribution of services. Additionally, we performed a suitability analysis to pinpoint priority zones for potential network expansion, aiming to bolster equitable access across the city.\n\n\nThis project addresses the following two research questions:\n\nHow equitable is the access to Bike Share Toronto for all Toronto residents, especially for population subgroups based on gender, income or ethnicity?\nWhich Bike Share Toronto service areas have higher or lower levels of equity, and where should the system expansion be prioritized to improve the service provision equity?\n\nYou can find the code used in this project by clicking here and the online dashboard through this link.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here.\n\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "text": "Workflow\n\nGenerate 3D building models on the UF campus\n\nIn the ArcGIS CityEngine, first, create a new project with a new scene. Then click file &gt; get map data, selecting the UF campus area. After that, align the downloaded 3D building models to the terrains. Finally, export the 3D building models into Esri Scene Layer Package (.slpk).\n\nDownload the JSON file from RTS API and convert it into Geojson\n\nDue to the API limitations, there is no command to return all the vehicles’ locations. To get around this, we need to create a python script to automate the multiple downloads and merge them into one file. In the “download_request_example.py”, I called the API four times to return different routes’ bus locations which together merged into one JSON that contains all the vehicle locations. Please note that each time I called the API, I filtered the JSON response from the API. Only after the proper filter, the JSON file’s structure is recognizable and convertible by the converter python script. Also, I created four artificial vehicle locations at the end of the JSON file which contains all four different occupancy levels of the buses, by doing this the legend in the later web app would always contain the four occupancy levels.\nThen we use the cmd to call the converter python script. Firstly, we set the directory to where the converter is located. Then we use the following code:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" Json2GeoJSON.py &lt;json file location&gt;\nAfter the first run, the converter python script would create an ini file alongside the JSON file you use as the input. The first conversion would likely be unsuccessful as the configuration in the ini file is just created and not manually corrected based on the input data. After the first conversion, correct the ini file to exactly the same as the gainData.ini.\n\nUpload the models and layers to ArcGIS Online\n\nGet all the background layers like City of Gainesville roads, transit routes and stops from the city website’s open data portal. Upload all the background layers as well as the slpk file in step 1 and the Geojson file in step 2 to the ArcGIS online. Note: create a hosted feature layer for the Geojson file during the upload, as we will later constantly update it to make a real-time map.\n\nCreate a web scene and further use it to create a web app\n\nIn ArcGIS Online, use the feature layers that have been uploaded to firstly create a web scene. Then create a web app using the web scene. Remember in the web scene setting to set the refresh time to the minimum, which will reduce the update interval in the ArcGIS server later.\n\nConfig constant upload bat file in a local computer\n\nBefore updating the hosted feature layer that contains the vehicle information, we need to first store the ArcGIS authentication locally. Due to the UF Gatorlink using two-factor authentication to log in, it would be troublesome to simply store the username and password on the computer. The way to get around this is to first use the following python command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(url=&lt;organization_arcgis_portal&gt;, username='', password='', profile='learn_user')\nThis command would store your username and password in the learn_user profile, however, so far it cannot go through the ArcGIS Online portal yet. After this then, before updating the feature layer, call the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment while keeping ArcGIS Pro running in the background:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(\"pro\", profile='learn_user')\nThis command would use ArcGIS Pro to authenticate the profile called learn_user. Please note that use the same account you use in ArcGIS Online in ArcGIS Pro.\nThen we can update the hosted feature layer that contains all the vehicle locations by the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" OverwriteFS.py learn_user &lt;ID&gt; &lt;Name&gt; &lt;location of your downloaded json file&gt;\nNote the ID and the name correspond to the upper right corner and the lower-left corner respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use the windows task scheduler to run the bat file every minute to automatically update the hosted feature layer. Or we can use the Invisible_mode_exxec.vbs to hiddenly execute the bat file. Please note that if you want to schedule a task to run the vbs, you need to use the following setting:\nAction: Start a program\nProgram/script: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\nAdd arguments (optional): C:\\Scripts\\script.vbs"

However, this also means that it may take some time to load in the web browser. The app displays the histogram of the sample distribution, as well as the histogram and normal quantile plot of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for simulated samples drawn from various distributions, such as normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others. The app demonstrates that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be approximately normal, as long as the sample size is large enough.\nTo access the web app, please click on this link."
